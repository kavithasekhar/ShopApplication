Please Note:
GIT was originally installed by another user in my laptop. I changed the git config user.name and user.email to mine 
but still I wasn't able to do my first commit in my name. However, I was able to do the subsequent commits in my username.

Thus, You will see a different username in the first GIT checkin - kalirajan. I added that another user as a collaborator 
and pushed my first commit to remote repository.
